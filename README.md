This respository provides examples of AI and machine learning programs and programming exercises. 

Three of these programs are implementations of the wave function collapse algorithm. These are:

A Sudoku solver which takes an incomplete board as input:

A Crossword generator which takes a dictionary of words and a structure defining overlaps and length as input:

A pattern generator which takes a set of tiles as input, identifies their matching edges with rotation and builds a grid of a defined size:

The genetic project uses a custom neural network with random initial weights as the basis for a genetic algorithm to find a optimal player of the game Flappy Bird:

The nim project uses reinforcement learning to train an optimal player in the game Nim:

Tictactoe is an implementation of the two-player minimax algorithm:

Minesweeper uses propositional logic to create an optimal minsweeper player:

Some other (less visual) projects in this repository:

* Shopping uses a k-nearest-neighbour classifier to predict user behaviour.

* Pagerank implements the Google Pagerank algorithm for web search.

* Traffic trains a convolutional neural network to recognise road signs.

* Heredity uses bayesian networks to model the inheritance of genetic traits.

* Degrees uses breadth-first search to identify the shortest route between two actors based on film credits.
